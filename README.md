# Search Visualizer

A learning project in React, inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's
[Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer). The main project goal is to get some experience with
React beyond tutorials. To that end, I've avoided referencing the repository above or the development process "tutorial" that goes with it.

Hopefully this project is interesting enough to be realistic and to enable creativity, without requiring a huge scope to be completed.
